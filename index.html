    <h2>The story</h2>

    <p>Once upon a time there was a Chinese farmer whose horse ran away. That evening, all of his neighbors came around
        to commiserate. They said, <q class="villagers">“We are so sorry to hear your horse has run away. This is most
            unfortunate.”</q> The farmer said, <q class="farmer"><em>“Maybe.”</em></q> The next day the horse came back
        bringing seven wild horses with it, and in the evening everybody came back and said,
        <q class="villagers">“Oh,
            isn’t that lucky. What a great turn of events. You now have eight horses!”</q>
            The farmer again said,
        <q class="farmer"><em>“Maybe.”</em></q>
    </p>

    <p>The following day his son tried to break one of the horses, and while riding it, he was thrown and broke his     leg.
        The neighbors then said, <q class="villagers">“Oh dear, that’s too
            <mark class="bad">bad</mark>
            ,”</q> and the farmer responded, <q class="farmer"><em>“Maybe.”</em></q> The next day the conscription
        officers came around to conscript people into the army, and they rejected his son because he had a broken       leg.
        Again all the neighbors came around and said, <q class="villagers">“Isn’t that great!”</q> Again, he said,
        <q class="farmers"><em>“Maybe.”</em></q>
    </p>

    <blockquote>
        <p>The whole process of nature is an integrated process of immense complexity, and it’s really impossible to
            tell whether anything that happens in it is
            <mark class="good">good</mark>
            or
            <mark class="bad">bad</mark>
            — because you never know what will be the consequence of the misfortune; or, you never know what will be the
            consequences of
            <mark class="good">good</mark>
            fortune.
        </p>

    <h2>Conclusion</h2>
    <p>
        <mark class="good">Good</mark>
        and
        <mark class="bad">Bad</mark>
        are just one perspective. Bananas are
        <mark class="good">good</mark>
        for monkeys, but monkeys are not
        <mark class="good">good</mark>
        for bananas. Let's not make a big deal out of it...
